With Prof. Guth, I’m studying the finite field projection theory. I’ve come up with sieve theory methods, similar to that of Linnik’s Large Sieve, that give sharp estimates that depend on spacing conditions.

Our basic projection theory setup is as follows. Let $$p$$ be a prime, $$X \subset \mathbb{F}_{p}^{2}$$ be a set of points and $$D \subset \mathbb{F}_{p}$$ be a set of directions. For each direction $$\theta \in D$$, we define $$\pi_{\theta}(x) = x_{1} + \theta x_{2}$$ as the projection in the $$\theta$$ direction. We are interested in bounding
\begin{equation}
S = S(X, D) = \max_{\theta \in D} |\pi_\theta(X)|.
\end{equation}
Our main goal is to make progress towards the following conjecture:
\begin{equation}
|D| \lesssim \frac{S^2}{|X|}.
\end{equation}
